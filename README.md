# The Fishmonger Problem
A fishmonger is alone in the shop and either serves customers, if there are any in the shop, or rests if there are no customers. 
The shop is not a big one and only a number of clients can be in the shop at any given time, let's say four. 
Customers are served one at the time in the order they entered the shop, and once served, the fishmonger says goodbye and they leave the shop. 
If the shop is empty and the fishmonger is resting, on arrival a new customer rings the bell and wakes the fishmonger up. 
If the shop is full, customers cannot enter and they leave, renouncing to buy fish that day.
